# Goal
This repository illustrates my attempts to train various machine learning
algorithms on the famous wisconsin breast cancer data set. Successful fitted models
with +90% accuracy include:
+ K Nearest Neighbours
+ Support Vector Machines
+ Single Layer Neural Network (surprisingly the least accurate)
