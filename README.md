# Goal
This repository illustrates my attempts to train various machine learning
algorithms on the famous wisconsin breast cancer data set. Successful fitted models
with +90% accuracy include:
+ K Nearest Neighbours
+ Support Vector Machines
+ Single Layer Neural Network (surprisingly the least accurate)
+ C5.0 Decision Tree

Confusion tables represents true predictions, false positives and negatives for
each algorithm. They were generated by comparing the predicted values to the
acutal values in the testing data set.
A value of 2 represents benign cells, while a value of 4 represents malignant cells.
Graphical representations of the models provided by the plot function are also included.

## K Nearest Neighbours
25 mistakes out of 560 data points.

| Matches  |         2 |   4 |
| ---      |     ----- | --- |
| 2        |       356 |   8 |
| 4        |        17 | 179 |
| Accuracy | 0.9553571       |

## Support Vector Machine
26 Mistakes out 560. Roughly the same as K nearest neighbours.

| Matches  |         2 |     4 |
| ---      |       --- | ----- |
| 2        |       348 |    16 |
| 4        |        10 |   186 |
| Accuracy | 0.9410714         |

Note that this graph only shows the division as a function of only 1 factor. In
reality, the division is an n-dimensional hyperplane.

## Neural Network
Slightly worse than the other two models. However, increasing the number of
nodes in hidden layer might yield better results.

| Matches  |         2 |     4 |
| ---      |       --- | ----- |
| 2        |       349 |    17 |
| 4        |        16 |   178 |
| Accuracy | 0.9410714         |

## C5.0 Decision Tree
Best model so far with 23 mistakes. 

| Matches  |         2 |   4 |
| ---      |       --- | --- |
| 2        |       357 |  14 |
| 4        |         9 | 180 |
| Accuracy | 0.9678571       |
